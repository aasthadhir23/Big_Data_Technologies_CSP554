Big data is a field of computer science that deals with large amounts of data. This course will teach you how to use the latest technology to manage big data. We'll start by describing the different types of big data and then focus on the Hadoop software framework. We'll also cover some specialized database systems designed to work with big data. Finally, we'll explain how to make good decisions when using big data technologies. If you have basic computer science knowledge, this course will be a great introduction to big data.
